V7 Mindustry hjson mod that add modded maps for you to beat with all the vanilla contents provides.
# note
- the only thing in this mod that mainly provide is the maps, contents besides that aren't accessible to players directly.
- best to use only with vanilla for the right experience.
- this both my first experience in making mod and mapping, so don't expect something spectacular, i just hope this could be fun for people.
